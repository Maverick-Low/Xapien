Hi

This is my submission for the Tech Test - LLM Response Parsing. Hope you enjoy reading unit tests :)

To run this project:
@directory Xapien

1. Create virtual environment: 'python -m venv env'
2. Activate virtual environment: '.\env\Scripts\activate'
3. Install pytest: 'pip install pytest'
4. Run the test script: 'pytest TestExtractor.py'

Hope to hear from you soon about this - appreciate your time.
